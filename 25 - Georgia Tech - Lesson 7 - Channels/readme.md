# Georgia Tech - Lesson 7 - Channels

Virtual lesson for students from Medellin, a program from Georgia Tech. I had the oportunity to discuss about channels as a part of business model creation. Here you would found some information that I used it to preparated the session. The main resource was a virtual course from Udacity, How to build a StartUp.

## Questions for the groups

- How does the product get from the company to the customer? Physical channel / Virtual channel
- Do you have a budget for your business?
- What are your channels? (Explain in a few words)
- It is Direct or a Indirect channel?
- What's going to be your first distribution channel?
- How your business it's going to make money? How is or would be your channel economics?

## Final thoughs

- Choose few channels to start, just one it's ok
- Remember how your company it's going to make money
- Be minimalist, use few words, canvas model it's just one page proposition
- A free o cheaper channel doesn't mean bad quiality or bad idea
- A expensive channel maybe it's not a good idea to start, look for free options
- Everything it's related in your business model
- Everything it's important to your company to exist
